# skill-indx-search

> Targets IndxSearchLib v4.1.2 and IndxCloudApi v1.0.2.
> AI agents can sometimes produce incorrect code. Always verify generated output against the [official documentation](https://docs.indx.co/api-41).

Everything your AI coding agent needs to understand, install, and integrate [Indx Search](https://indx.co) in your project.

Give your agent **[SKILL.md](./SKILL.md)** and it will know how to:

- Choose between the C# NuGet library and the HTTP API
- Configure fields, queries, filters, boosts, and coverage tuning
- Write working code in C#, Node.js/TypeScript, or plain REST
- Load data and deploy to production
