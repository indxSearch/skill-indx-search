# skill-indx-search

> **Beta** — This skill is under active development.

An agent skill that teaches AI coding assistants how to integrate [Indx Search](https://indx.co) — a high-performance search engine using pattern recognition instead of tokenizers or stemmers.

## What's in here

The main content is **[SKILL.md](./SKILL.md)**. It covers:

- Choosing between the C# NuGet library and the HTTP API
- Field configuration, querying, filters, boosts, and coverage tuning
- Complete code examples for C#, Node.js/TypeScript, and REST
- Data loading workflows and production deployment

Point your AI agent at `SKILL.md` and it will know how to wire up Indx Search in your project.
